       <h1>Orbit.js</h1>
   </br>
   <p class = "desc">"A library to smoothly animate the orbit of planets in our solar system and customized planets!"</p>
   <p class="link"><a href="api.html">API Documentation</a></p>
   <h3 class="ex1">Example #1</h3>
   <pre>
      <code>
         const orbit = new Orbit(screen.width / 2, 625, 20);
         orbit.orbit(['mercury', 'venus', 'earth', 'mars', 'jupiter', 'saturn', 'uranus', 'neptune']);
         orbit.planetInfo();
      </code>
   </pre>
   <p>Here we have an example of the library in which there is very minimal user interaction. The user can hover over the sun
      to be presented with information regarding the atmosphere of each planet on display. The user clicks the sun to cycle through
      information for each planet. In this example, the planets are actually scaled to size accurately (not including the sun).
      These exact planet sizes are a default in the library but can be overwritten by the user. This example could be used in a 
      program where the developer wants to display an accurate representation of the planets in our solar system, without the need 
      for changing the animation, such as a figure for an educational site on the solar system.
   </p>
   <h3 class="ex2">Example #2</h3>
   <pre>
      <code>
         const orbit2 = new Orbit(((screen.width / 4) * 3) - 100, 1550, 20, '#aa66cc');
         const pluto = orbit2.makePlanet(33, 'black', 1062, 330, 'pluto');
         orbit2.orbit(['mercury', 'venus', 'earth', 'mars', 'jupiter', 'saturn', 'uranus', 'neptune', pluto]);
         orbit2.displayPlanets();
         orbit2.planetInfo();
      </code>
   </pre>
   <p class="para2"> Here we have an example of the library in which there is more user interaction. The user can toggle checkboxes
      to determine which planets they want displayed on the screen. Furthermore, they can click the remove buttons to delete a planet
      completely. The user can still hover their cursor over the sun to invoke a pop-up with information regarding each planet. This 
      example could be used once again in an educational setting where students are encouraged to compare the orbits of 2 planets at a 
      time or perhaps to observe what the solar system would look like without particular planets. This example also shows that the colour 
      of the sun can be set to anything. Pluto is so small compared to the others, it can barely be seen!
   </p>
   <h3 class="ex3">Example #3</h3>
   <pre>
      <code>
         const orbit3 = new Orbit(((screen.width / 4) * 3) - 100, 2450, 20, '#33FF66');
         const apes = orbit2.makePlanet(26, 'black', 30000, 280, 'planetOfTheApes');
         orbit3.orbit(['mercury', 'venus', 'earth', 'mars', 'jupiter', apes]);
         orbit3.addPlanet();
         orbit3.displayPlanets();
         orbit3.planetInfo();
      </code>
   </pre>
   <p class="para3"> Here we have an example of the library in which there is maximum user interaction. In addition to the functionality
      from examples 1 and 2, users are able to add custom planets to the animation. This allows the user to completely customize their
      own solar system! This example could be used in an educational setting in which students are encouraged to add moons or planets from
      other solar systems or galaxies to the animation and compare them against planets of our solar system.
